      <p>Pandora is an easy box on Hack The Box. I found that, despite the classifaction, that this box is quite difficult for an "easy" box.</p>
      <p>In this box there are alot of steps and alot of exploits that will not work. I believe I tried over 10 different exploits in the user phase before finding something that works.</p>
      <p>Anyways, I hope that you enjoy this walkthrough.</p>

          To start out with I did a simple TCP nmap scan using <br><code>nmap -sC -sV 10.10.11.136</code><br>
          to see what ports were open. When the scan completed I only saw ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP) open.
        </p>

        <p>
          I first looked into the contents of the website. After some poking around and testing for XSS in a 
          messaging form I decided to look elsewhere.
        </p>
        <src>Image here</src>
        <p>
          It took me some time to realized but I then remembered I could do a UDP scan with nmap
          <br><code>sudo nmap -sU -sC -sV 10.10.11.136</code><br>
          This run showed port 161 open on UDP. After some research on the port number I found that it 
          was an SNMP server.
        </p>
        <src>Image here</src>
        <p>
          I figured that this stood out and that it was worth looking into. I found a tool online that would 
          allow me to get more information on the port. Now using <br><code>snmpwalk -c public 10.10.11.136 -v1 > snmpwalk.out</code><br>
          I was able to get information more information on the service.
        </p>
        <src>Image here</src>
        <p>
          While parsing the output I found some pain text credentials for a non-privledged user on the system.
        </p>
        <src>Image here</src>
        <p>
          For more context, snmpwalk will run multiple GETNEXT requests automatically. The SNMP GETNEXT request is used 
          to query an enabled device and take SNMP data from a device. This can return a large amount of information including 
          command input which could reveal credentials if they were entered in the command line.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have a valid set of credentials we can get our foothold by logging in over ssh.
          <br><code>ssh [redacted]@10.10.11.136</code><br>
